## Facade Design Pattern

Unifies several calls to multiple methods into a single call. To make it work, it's needed to create a class with a method. That method will instance one or multiple objects and will call the other methods.

Is tipically used when:
- An interface is required to access a complex system 
- The abstractions and implementations of a subsystem are tightly coupled.
- Need an entry point to each level of layered software.
- System is very complex or difficult to understand.
