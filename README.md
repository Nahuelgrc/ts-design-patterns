## Facade Design Pattern

Unifies several calls to multiple methods into a single call. To make it work, it's needed to create a class with a method. That method will instance one or multiple objects and will call the other methods.

Is tipically used when:
- An interface is required to access a complex system.
- The abstractions and implementations of a subsystem are tightly coupled.
- Need an entry point to each level of layered software.
- System is very complex or difficult to understand.

## Adapter Design Pattern

The idea of this design pattern is to copy the same behavior as one in the real world. A class is created that bridges the gap between an expected interface and an existing class. That enables to reuse an existing class that doesnâ€™t implement a required interface and to use the functionality of multiple classes, that would otherwise be incompatible. It is useful when we want incompatible interfaces to work with each other.
